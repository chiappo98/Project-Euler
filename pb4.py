#A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
#The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit 
#numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

#Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


#possible steps:
#       -among 6-digit numbers find those that are palindrome
#        (starting from 999999 and going back)
#       -the number must be the product of TWO 3-digit numbers

#a 3-digit number goes from 100 to 999
